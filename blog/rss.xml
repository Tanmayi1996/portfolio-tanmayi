            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there have been various studies which mentions tech writer's struggle to make decent pay.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-glassdor-says">What Glassdor says?<a href="#what-glassdor-says" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Glassdor says?" title="Direct link to What Glassdor says?">​</a></h2><p><strong>Dear Tech Writer Comrades!!</strong></p><p>You know, According to data from Glassdoor, the average salary for a technical writer in India is around INR 4.5 lakhs per year. This is significantly lower than the average salary for an engineer, which can range from INR 6 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs per year.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-tech-writing">What is tech writing?<a href="#what-is-tech-writing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is tech writing?" title="Direct link to What is tech writing?">​</a></h2><p>Technical writing is a crucial part of the engineering process, as it involves creating clear and accurate documentation for complex technical systems and processes.
You play a vital role in ensuring that this documentation is easily understood by a wide range of audiences, including engineers, technical professionals, and laypeople. Despite this important function, technical writers in India often struggle to earn as much as their engineering counterparts, despite being an integral part of the engineering team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-are-tech-writers-struggling">Why are tech writers struggling?<a href="#why-are-tech-writers-struggling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why are tech writers struggling?" title="Direct link to Why are tech writers struggling?">​</a></h2><p>One possible reason for this could be that technical writing is not as highly valued or recognized as other engineering roles. Engineers are often seen as the "brain" behind a project, while technical writers are viewed as the "support" team.
